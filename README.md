# Advent of Code

This is just a repository to store my solutions to the Advent of Code and to learn Rust.

## Updates 

On day 9 I decided to transfer the whole project into a package, so I wouldn't have to write some helper functions for each and every one of the solutions.

This ended up being much more difficult than expected.
